exploratory Testing

get s3 to be maps.mindmup.com

-- hide export if map changed, leave a message to save before exporting
-- hide toolbar on phone/add menu with edit items...

- add some info into README.md - setup/run project/env variables....

// default.json to offline, deal with it as with a script (setup_offline)
// config.ru - make session secret configurable
// migrate to other base64 library & change in setup_offline.sh
// web.rb
   // publishing config to @ vars
   // make max upload size configurable
   // @mapId to @map_id
// kill help
//welcome message. add message id to data-message in dom, move script out to check onload if there is a welcome message, and if so, log activity


-- review if we export through client or server /  review export paths if we keep them on the server




move /public/css and /public/js into /public

- canvas editor needs love!
  - split out functional stuff from layout/menu stuff
  - move toolbar out into a jquery widget
- feedback.js needs love!

- views
  - analytics.erb into two javascript files, select in layout which one to load

  - alert to a javascript file
  - move editor specific stuff from layout into editor
  - perhaps move social scripts into a separate erb from layout
  - move script out of voting 
     -- should alert/feedback/voting go into same script or not? perhaps compile + minimise.... 
        perhaps keep individual files in /public/js and compile to /public

 
 
 --- later ---

========================
- pure DOM renderer.
  
Later:
--Popup on canvas map 
--externalise canvas style configuration (radius, backgrounds, wordwrap limits...)
context sensitive menus

 - performance test on erb inside erb compared to just a single erb
