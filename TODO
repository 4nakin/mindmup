- get s3 to be maps.mindmup.com
- hide export if map changed, leave a message to save before exporting
- hide toolbar on phone/add menu with edit items...
- review if we export through client or server /  review export paths if we keep them on the server

- mapWidget - initial stage y
- merge welcomeMessageWidget with trackingWidget (the only difference is that stuff happens on load rather than on click)
- change routing_spec.rb (welp?) && drop attributes from container div in editor.erb
- discuss analytics_spec.rb (always have analytics? use non-prod account)

========================
- pure DOM renderer.
- Popup on canvas map
- externalise canvas style configuration (radius, backgrounds, wordwrap limits...)
