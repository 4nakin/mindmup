- get s3 to be maps.mindmup.com
- hide export if map changed, leave a message to save before exporting
- hide toolbar on phone/add menu with edit items...
- review if we export through client or server /  review export paths if we keep them on the server

- keyboard navigation to cousin
- expand collapse
- large map layout
- background colour
- mapWidget - initial stage y
- merge welcomeMessageWidget with trackingWidget (the only difference is that stuff happens on load rather than on click)
- floating toolbar - move markup from javacript into .erb
- make saving form dynamic (i.e. create it from javascript)

- in kinetic.idea, we are doing this:
  	unformattedText = joinLines(config.text),
	it is only required to remove embedded formatting from previously saved maps. If gojko can do awk magic on the previously saved maps
	we can get rid of this.
	
========================

- Popup on canvas map
- externalise canvas style configuration (radius, backgrounds, wordwrap limits...)
- context sensitive menus
- performance test on erb inside erb compared to just a single erb
